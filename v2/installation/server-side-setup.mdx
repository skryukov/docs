title: Server-Side Setup
---

The first step when installing Inertia is to configure your server-side framework. Inertia maintains an official server-side adapter for [Laravel](https://laravel.com/). For other frameworks, please see the [community adapters](/v2/installation/community-adapters).

Inertia is fine-tuned for Laravel, so the documentation examples on this website utilize Laravel. For examples of using Inertia with other server-side frameworks, please refer to the framework specific documentation maintained by that adapter.

Laravel's starter kits provide out-of-the-box scaffolding for new Inertia applications.

These starter kits are the absolute fastest way to start building a new Inertia project using Laravel and Vue or React. However, if you would like to manually install Inertia into your application, please consult the documentation below.

## Installation

<Steps>
    <Step title="Install dependencies">
        First, install the Inertia server-side adapter using the Composer package manager.

        ```bash
        composer require inertiajs/inertia-laravel
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Setup root template">
        Next, setup the root template that will be loaded on the first page visit to your application. This template should include your site's CSS and JavaScript assets, along with the `@inertia` and `@inertiaHead` directives.

        ```blade
        <html>
            <head>
                <meta charset="utf-8" />
                <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
                @vite('resources/js/app.js')
                @inertiaHead
            </head>
            <body>
                @inertia
            </body>
        </html>
        ```

        For React applications, it's recommended to include the `@viteReactRefresh` directive before the `@vite` directive to enable Fast Refresh in development.

        The `@inertia` directive renders a `<div>` element with an `id` of `app`. This element serves as the mounting point for your JavaScript application. You may customize the `id` by passing a different value to the directive.

        ```blade
        <html>
            ...
            <body>
                @inertia('custom-app-id')
            </body>
        </html>
        ```

        If you change the `id` of the root element, be sure to update it [client-side](/v2/installation/client-side-setup#defining-a-root-element) as well.

        By default, Inertia's Laravel adapter will assume your root template is named `app.blade.php`. If you would like to use a different root view, you can change it using the `Inertia::setRootView()` method.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Register middleware">
        Next we need to setup the Inertia middleware. You can accomplish this by publishing the `HandleInertiaRequests` middleware to your application, which can be done using the following Artisan command.

        ```sh
        php artisan inertia:middleware
        ```

        Once the middleware has been published, append the `HandleInertiaRequests` middleware to the `web` middleware group in your application's `bootstrap/app.php` file.

        ```php
        use App\Http\Middleware\HandleInertiaRequests;

        ->withMiddleware(function (Middleware $middleware) {
            $middleware->web(append: [
                HandleInertiaRequests::class,
            ]);
        })
        ```

        This middleware provides a `version()` method for setting your [asset version](/v2/advanced/asset-versioning), as well as a `share()` method for defining [shared data](/v2/data-props/shared-data).
    </Step>

    <Step title="Create your first response">
        That's it, you're all ready to go server-side! Now you're ready to start creating Inertia [pages](/v2/the-basics/pages) and rendering them via [responses](/v2/the-basics/responses).

        ```php
        use Inertia\Inertia;

        class EventsController extends Controller
        {
            public function show(Event $event)
            {
                return Inertia::render('Event/Show', [
                    'event' => $event->only(
                        'id',
                        'title',
                        'start_date',
                        'description',
                    ),
                ]);
            }
        }
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>
