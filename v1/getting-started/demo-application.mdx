<Warning>This is documentation for Inertia.js v1, which is no longer actively maintained. Please refer to the [v2 docs](/v2) for the latest information.</Warning>

We've setup a demo app for Inertia.js called [Ping CRM](https://demo.inertiajs.com). This application is built using Laravel and Vue. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/inertiajs/pingcrm).

The Ping CRM demo is hosted on Heroku and the database is reset every hour. Please be respectful when editing data.

[![Ping CRM](/images/pingcrm.png)](https://demo.inertiajs.com)In addition to the Vue version of Ping CRM, we also maintain a Svelte version of the application, which you can find [on GitHub](https://github.com/inertiajs/pingcrm-svelte).
