## Defining routes

When using Inertia, all of your application's routes are defined server-side. This means that you don't need Vue Router or React Router. Instead, you can simply define Laravel routes and return [Inertia responses](/v1/the-basics/responses) from those routes.

## Shorthand routes

If you have a [page](/v1/the-basics/pages) that doesn't need a corresponding controller method, like an "FAQ" or "about" page, you can route directly to a component via the `Route::inertia()` method.

```php
Route::inertia('/about', 'About');
```

## Generating URLs

Some server-side frameworks allow you to generate URLs from named routes. However, you will not have access to those helpers client-side. Here are a couple ways to still use named routes with Inertia.

The first option is to generate URLs server-side and include them as props. Notice in this example how we're passing the `edit_url` and `create_url` to the `Users/Index` component.

```php
class UsersController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        return Inertia::render('Users/Index', [
            'users' => User::all()->map(function ($user) {
                return [
                    'id' => $user->id,
                    'name' => $user->name,
                    'email' => $user->email,
                    'edit_url' => route('users.edit', $user),
                ];
            }),
            'create_url' => route('users.create'),
        ]);
    }
}
```

However, when using Laravel, the [Ziggy](https://github.com/tightenco/ziggy) library can make your named, server-side routes available to you via a global `route()` function. In fact, if you are developing an application using one of Laravel's [starter kits](https://laravel.com/docs/starter-kits), Ziggy is already configured for you.

If you're using Ziggy with Vue, it's helpful to make this function available as a custom `$route`property so you can use it directly in your templates.
